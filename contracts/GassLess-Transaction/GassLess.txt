Gasless token transfers on Ethereum allow users to send 
tokens without directly paying gas fees in ETH. Instead, 
gas fees are typically paid by a relayer or covered through 
other mechanisms like sponsorship or meta-transactions. 
This is particularly useful for improving user experience, 
especially for new users who might not hold ETH but want to interact with dApps.

 EIP-2612 allow token holders to approve transfers by singing a message off-chain, which a relayer can 
 then submit to the blokchain , saving the user paying from gas fees.
