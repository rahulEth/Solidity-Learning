# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help

create new folder 
npx hardhat 

Compile
npx hardhat compile

Run unit tests
npx hardhat test

Start local node
npx hardhat node

Deploy to Rinkeby
npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.js

Verify smart contract on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby "address-of-contract" "Constructor argument 1"

Start hardhat console on localhost
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```
